        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As I am finishing my last semester of college and pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I have developed a strong foundation in software development through hands-on experience with languages, such as C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have contributed to the development of innovative software applications, where I become more competent with computer programming and working in collaborative settings. My area of expertise also includes creating, configuring and troubleshooting computer networks in Cybersecurity. I am eager to apply my technical abilities to gain practical skills, interact with specialized technology and contribute to real-world projects.

                <h3>Internal Security Audit</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-life internal security audit for a fictional organization called Botium Toys. I identified the scope and goal of the audit, existing assets, security controls, and best practices for business regulatory compliance. Then, I started a risk assessment to determine which risks should be prioritized for optimizing the security posture and that could harm the organization if left unchecked. Following this step, I filled in a checklist to keep track of the security controls and compliance best practices that the organization contains. The results from this checklist allowed me to come up with recommendations for improving the organization's security posture and compliance with security standards, such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC type 1 and SOC type 2. This project gave me hands-on experience with the different phases of internal security audits and helped me gain profitable skills in Cybersecurity; I acquired skills in threat detection and analysis, risk assessment, and incident response planning. I have also developed a greater understanding of IT security frameworks and standards.</p>

                <h3>Expense Tracking Website</h3>
                <p>The purpose for this project is to use an AI Agent to provide end users with a way to simply analyze their financial assets to gain an estimate of the total expenses and share feedback on efficient money saving strategies for the future. I worked on building the user authentication system in the login and regsitration pages of the website. For more reliable and secure data protection, I helped set up Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to host the web server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and safely send query requests to the DynamoDB database through an Amazon Linux Secure Shell (SSH tunnel. I also helped implement an AI Agent with an OpenAI SDK that includes GPT 3.5 Turbo models and train the AI with Machine Learning algorithms to predict overspending or anomalies in the client's financial history. From this project, I gained more experience with using Amazon Web Services and implementing Generative AI into programming.</p>

                <h3>E-commerce Game Launcher App</h3>
                <p>The goal for this project is to provide end-users a way to purchase video games and play them without having to go outside. It also helps connect users with family and friends to enjoy games together both physically and virtually. I took on the Full Stack programming role; I was responsible for designing the frontend to create more user-friendly interfaces and managing user authentication on the backend. I also set up unit tests and validation tests to check for program bugs. This project taught me how to use task managing interfaces, such as Jira, and gave me experience with Scrum Agile strategies in Software Engineering.</p>

                <h3>Image Location Searching AI</h3>
                <p>The main objective for this project is to construct an Artificial Intelligence that can take any image(*.png, *.jpg, etc..) and identify a specific location. I was responsible for designing the user interfaces, training the AI with an Azure Cognitive Services API, and authenticating users and encrypting data with MongoDB. In addition, I managed resources, secrets, and role-based access policies using Azure cloud services to make sure that all assets are secure and operational. From working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with programming AI, utilizing the cloud for accessing API services and maintaining the security of resources.</p>

                <h3>Simple Chat Application</h3>
                <p>I programmed and tested this C application by remotely connecting to the Ubuntu Linux distribution through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). My primary development and testing environment was in VsCode, which I also used for its automated Source Control features, through Git, to update and commit changes to the source code files faster on GitHub. It is a program that is exclusive for Linux operating systems and is ran by using the OS command shell. During the development of this program, I gained skills in programming code that would connect to network sockets, establishing peer-to-peer connections between different machines within a network, and hosting a server that would accept many connections simultaneously by the implementation of multithreading.</p>

                <h3>Simple Minesweeper game</h3>
                <p>A C program that focuses primarily on user input within the OS command shell. This program emulates the real Minesweeper game by implementing its logic and mechanics. While constructing this project, I researched the game rules of Minesweeper and even played the game itself for a bit. Using this newfound knowledge, I decided to create a simplified version of this game with the same gameplay and rules. This project helped me gain experience with simple game design and helped me grow as a programmer.</p>

                <h3>Word Ladder program</h3>
                <p>This Java program is inspired by the famous Word Ladder game. It follows the same rules with the same objective, which is to find a sequence of words given two starting words. This program uses a path searching algorithm using Linked Lists and Stacks. Personally, this was a difficult project to understand and program, but then I finally found my own solution by drawing pictures of how the algorithm works. After finishing this project, my problem solving skills, programming skills and knowledge of abstract data structures have improved.</p>
