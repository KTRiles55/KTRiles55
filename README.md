About Me
--------

As I am finishing my last semester of college and pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I have developed a strong foundation in software development through hands-on experience with languages, such as C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have contributed to the development of innovative software applications, where I become more competent with computer programming and working in collaborative settings. My area of expertise also includes creating, configuring and troubleshooting computer networks in Cybersecurity. I am eager to apply my technical abilities to gain practical skills, interact with specialized technology and contribute to real-world projects.

Projects
--------

*   ### E-commerce Game Launcher App
    
    The goal for this project is to provide end-users a way to purchase video games and play them without having to go outside. It also helps connect users with family and friends to enjoy games together both physically and virtually. I took on the Full Stack programming role; I was responsible for designing the frontend to create more user-friendly interfaces and managing user authentication on the backend. I also set up unit tests and validation tests to check for program bugs. This project taught me how to use task managing interfaces, such as Jira, and gave me experience with Scrum Agile strategies in Software Engineering.

*   ### Image Location Searching AI
    
    The main objective for this project is to construct an Artificial Intelligence that can take any image and identify a specific location. I was responsible for designing the user interfaces, training the AI with an Azure Cognitive Services API, and authenticating users and encrypting data with MongoDB. In addition, I managed resources, secrets, and role-based access policies using Azure cloud services to make sure that all assets are secure and operational. From working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with programming AI, utilizing the cloud for accessing API services and maintaining the security of resources.

*   ### Simple Minesweeper game
    
    A C program that focuses primarily on user input within the OS command shell. This program emulates the real Minesweeper game by implementing its logic and mechanics. While constructing this project, I researched the game rules of Minesweeper and even played the game itself for a bit. Using this newfound knowledge, I decided to create a simplified version of this game with the same gameplay and rules. This project helped me gain experience with simple game design and grow as a programmer.

*   ### Word Ladder program
    
    This Java program is inspired by the famous Word Ladder game. It follows the same rules with the same objective, which is to find a sequence of words given two starting words. This program uses a path searching algorithm using Linked Lists and Stacks. Personally, this was a difficult project to understand and program, but then I finally found my own solution by drawing pictures of how the algorithm works. After finishing this project, my problem solving skills, programming skills and knowledge of abstract data structures have improved.

*   ### Creature Battle program
    
    This project leverages class polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming by establishing an algorithm that allows the user to select two creatures to battle each other in a duel. Each creature possesses their own identity and stats. Once the two creatures are selected, they have a chance to duke it out in a 1-on-1 battle without any user intervention. This project improved my C++ programming skills and my knowledge of object-oriented programming.

*   ### Simple Blackjack game
    
    This project is made to resemble the real card game, Blackjack. It contains the same game rules, a dealer and you as the player. The player starts with 100 chips by default. In developing this project, I researched the rules of Blackjack and played the game in order to plan how to construct the code. Personally, I had a fun time building this program and it is one of my first Python projects.
