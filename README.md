About Me
--------

As a Computer Science graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree, I am passionate about developing, troubleshooting, and analyzing network security systems. I possess expertise in network analysis, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. Proficient in programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, HTML, and PHP, I have a strong foundation in application programming. My goal is to contribute to the Information Technology industry as a Cybersecurity Engineer, focusing on designing and optimizing application security networks to protect business assets from cyber threats.

Projects
--------
*   ### Incident Report
    
    In this project, I demonstrated skills in incident response, analysis, and digital forensics to document a professional report on my findings from a DDoS attack incident on an imaginary multimedia business. I applied knowledge of core functions in the NIST CSF framework to record my observations and came up with strategies to improve the organization's security posture and efficiently recover from the incident. From this project, I have gained a stronger understanding of the NIST CSF framework and how each of its core functions can be used to develop strategies to minimize security risks.

*   ### Internal Security Audit
    
    The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-life internal security audit for a fictional organization called Botium Toys. I identified the scope and goal of the audit, existing assets, security controls, and best practices for business regulatory compliance. Then, I started a risk assessment to determine which risks should be prioritized for optimizing the security posture and that could harm the organization if left unchecked. Following this step, I filled in a checklist to keep track of the security controls and compliance best practices that the organization contains. The results from this checklist allowed me to come up with recommendations for improving the organization's security posture and compliance with security standards, such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC type 1 and SOC type 2. This project gave me hands-on experience with the different phases of internal security audits and helped me gain profitable skills in Cybersecurity; I acquired skills in threat detection and analysis, risk assessment, and incident response planning. I have also developed a greater understanding of IT security frameworks and standards.

*   ### E-commerce Game Launcher App
    
    The goal for this project is to provide end-users a way to purchase video games and play them without having to go outside. It also helps connect users with family and friends to enjoy games together both physically and virtually. I took on the Full Stack programming role; I was responsible for designing the frontend to create more user-friendly interfaces and managing user authentication on the backend. I also set up unit tests and validation tests to check for program bugs. This project taught me how to use task managing interfaces, such as Jira, and gave me experience with Scrum Agile strategies in Software Engineering.

*   ### Image Location Searching AI
    
    The main objective for this project is to construct an Artificial Intelligence that can take any image and identify a specific location. I was responsible for designing the user interfaces, training the AI with an Azure Cognitive Services API, and authenticating users and encrypting data with MongoDB. In addition, I managed resources, secrets, and role-based access policies using Azure cloud services to make sure that all assets are secure and operational. From working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with programming AI, utilizing the cloud for accessing API services and maintaining the security of resources.

*   ### Simple Minesweeper game
    
    A C program that focuses primarily on user input within the OS command shell. This program emulates the real Minesweeper game by implementing its logic and mechanics. While constructing this project, I researched the game rules of Minesweeper and even played the game itself for a bit. Using this newfound knowledge, I decided to create a simplified version of this game with the same gameplay and rules. This project helped me gain experience with simple game design and grow as a programmer.

*   ### Word Ladder program
    
    This Java program is inspired by the famous Word Ladder game. It follows the same rules with the same objective, which is to find a sequence of words given two starting words. This program uses a path searching algorithm using Linked Lists and Stacks. Personally, this was a difficult project to understand and program, but then I finally found my own solution by drawing pictures of how the algorithm works. After finishing this project, my problem solving skills, programming skills and knowledge of abstract data structures have improved.
