About Me
--------

I am finishing my last semester of college and pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Since my childhood, I have been interested in computer technology and developing software applications. Throughout the years, I've gained skills in programming with languages, such as C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have also worked on desktop applications with other programmers on campus. These experiences helped shape me into a proficient programmer and team player. My goal is to get a career in Cyber Security Engineering.

Projects
--------

*   ### E-commerce Game Launcher App
    
    The goal for this project is to provide end-users a way to purchase video games and play them without having to go outside. It also helps connect users with family and friends to enjoy games together both physically and virtually. I collaborated with a group of classmates and we each fulfilled roles while using the Scrum Agile project management strategy. I took on the Full Stack programming role; I was responsible for the frontend and backend of the program, as well as the unit testing and validation testing. This project taught me how to use task managing interfaces, such as Jira, and the importance of working with a team in the Software Engineering industry.

*   ### Image Location Searching AI
    
    The main objective for this senior-design project is to construct an Artificial Intelligence that can take any image(*.png, *.jpg, etc..) and identify a specific location. I grouped up with some of my peers and worked on the Full Stack of the software. We chose to work with the Azure API for training the AI, the Google Maps API for the GPS Location services and MongoDB for the database. I've contributed to the frontend, AI training and storing data in the database. From working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with programming AI and utilizing the cloud for accessing API services.

*   ### Simple Minesweeper game
    
    A C program that focuses primarily on user input within the OS command shell. This program emulates the real Minesweeper game by implementing its logic and mechanics. While constructing this project, I researched the game rules of Minesweeper and even played the game itself for a bit. Using this newfound knowledge, I decided to create a simplified version of this game with the same gameplay and rules. This project helped me gain experience with simple game design and grow as a programmer.

*   ### Word Ladder program
    
    This Java program is inspired by the famous Word Ladder game. It follows the same rules with the same objective, which is to find a sequence of words given two starting words. This program uses a path searching algorithm using Linked Lists and Stacks. Personally, this was a difficult project to understand and program, but then I finally found my own solution by drawing pictures of how the algorithm works. After finishing this project, my problem solving skills, programming skills and knowledge of abstract data structures have improved.

*   ### Creature Battle program
    
    This project leverages class polymorphism and inheritance in object-oriented programming by establishing an algorithm that allows the user to select two creatures to battle each other in a duel. Each creature possesses their own identity and stats. Once the two creatures are selected, they have a chance to duke it out in a 1-on-1 battle without any user intervention. This project improved my C++ programming skills and my knowledge of object-oriented programming.

*   ### Simple Blackjack game
    
    This project is made to resemble the real card game, Blackjack. It contains the same game rules, a dealer and you as the player. The player starts with 100 chips by default. In developing this project, I researched the rules of Blackjack and played the game in order to plan how to construct the code. Personally, I had a fun time building this program and it was one of my first Python projects.
