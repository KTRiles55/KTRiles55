About Me
--------

I am finishing my last semester of college and pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Since my childhood, I have been interested in computer technology and developing software applications. Throughout the years, I've gained skills in programming with languages, such as C/C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I have also worked on desktop applications with other programmers on campus. These experiences helped shape me into a proficient programmer and team player. My goal is to get a career in Software Engineering.
